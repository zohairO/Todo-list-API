# Todo-list-API
This is a change 
This is my first project, a task manager API. My main goals for this project are to:

<p>  - Learn to setup and connect to the cloud database </p>
<p>  - perform all CRUD operations </p>
<p>  - persist data to the cloud </p>

Note that this todo app is not meant to be an easy regular app, as It is my first chance to
experiment with something real by using the cloud and persistence.
