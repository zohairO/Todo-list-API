# Todo-list-API
This is a change 
This is my first project, a task manager API. My main goals for this project are to:

<p>  - Learn to setup and connect to the cloud database </p>
<p>  - perform all CRUD operations </p>
<p>  - persist data to the cloud </p>

Note that while the front end and functionality of this app is quite simple and limited, I 
instead focused on playing around with something new which is the use of mongodb and the cloud.

<h2> Things I learnt from this project </h2>

<h3> MONGODB </h3>
<p> Using a database to store and persist the data is different from what I'm normally used to, which is storing the data in an arrray within a separate dataStore.js file. It took some time to understand and know the syntax and the way that mongodb is integrated within my node js code. </p>

<h3> Clear organisation of files and folders </h3>
<p> Another common and well used practice is to keep the 'main' app.js file as clean as possible. This means that I had to make a lot of separate files and folders for specific tasks e.g. routes and controllers and connection.</p>
